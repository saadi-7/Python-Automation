# Python-Automation

Corporate Bonds Web Scraper
This Python script uses the Selenium library to scrape information from the Corporate Bonds website. It logs in to the site, navigates to a specific page, and then clicks through a table of elements to gather data about each element.

Getting Started
To run this script, you will need to have Python installed on your machine, as well as the Selenium library. You will also need to download the Chrome driver and update the webdriver.Chrome() line of code to include the correct path to the driver.

Usage
Once you have set up the necessary dependencies, simply run the script in your Python environment. The script will automatically navigate to the Corporate Bonds website and begin scraping data.
